Overview 

An Android software called Hera's Meal Option Application was created to make meal selections easier according to the time of day. The application, which was created with Kotlin in Android Studio, uses "if" expressions to evaluate user input and recommend meals. It has an easy-to-use interface that allows you to enter the time of day and get a meal recommendation based on that information. 

Features 

Time-Based Meal Suggestions: Users can enter the time of day (morning, mid-morning, afternoon, mid-afternoon, dinner, and after dinner), and the app will suggest an appropriate meal. 
Reset Button: Clears the input field and meal suggestion display to allow for a fresh input. 
Minimalist UI: A clean and intuitive interface featuring an image, text inputs, and buttons for interaction. 
Android Studio Development: Designed and implemented using Android Studio, ensuring compatibility with modern Android devices. 
GitHub Version Control: The project is integrated with GitHub for version control, allowing for streamlined collaboration and tracking of changes. 
Automated Testing with GitHub Actions: Ensures code reliability through automated testing workflows, improving stability and maintainability. 

Elements of Design 

User Experience (UX): Put first usability and simplicity, allowing users to get meal recommendations fast. 
Responsiveness: The user interface design responds to various screen sizes with ease. 
Basic input validation is part of error handling to guarantee that meal recommendations are relevant. 
Maintainability: A code structure that is modular and includes comments for potential future improvements. 

Technology Stack 

Programming Language: Kotlin 
Development Environment: Android Studio 
Version Control: GitHub 

Integration of GitHub and GitHub Actions
